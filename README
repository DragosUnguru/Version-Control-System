# Tema2_POO / Unguru Dragos-Gabriel 325CD

	The purpose of this project is to implement
some basic functionalities of the bash commands
and a version control system.

	Using the same approach for both the filesystem
commands and the VCS commands.

	We'll store the filesystem format in vcs.activeSnapshot
which is updated for every other command. Using this, we can
manage the filesystem for every other commit.

	The active VCS has:
		-> a list of branches
		-> the active snapshot of the filesystem
		-> the branch we're working on
		-> the output writer, which manages the output

	Every branch is made of:
		-> a name
		-> a list of commits
		-> the staging (uncommited/unrolled filesystem	)
					   (		modifications			)

	And every commit has:
		-> an ID
		-> a tag/comment (commit arguments after -m)
		-> the snapshot of the filesystem at the moment
		   of the commit
